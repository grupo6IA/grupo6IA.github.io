I'm a student of Software Engineering at the Universidad Cat√≥lica del Uruguay, currently pursuing a minor in data science. It was during my studies, particularly in the 'Artificial Intelligence' course, that I embarked on creating this portfolio. I saw it as an opportunity to not only learn but also to apply the knowledge I gained, primarily through engaging and insightful Kaggle case studies.

The world of data science is an area I'm genuinely passionate about. It's a space where I find endless opportunities for exploration and problem-solving. The practical experiences and challenges I've encountered along my journey have solidified my commitment to this field.


I am a dedicated data enthusiast on a continuous journey of exploration and learning within the realm of machine learning, all seamlessly orchestrated with Python. My portfolio serves as a testament to my hands-on approach, where I tackle real-world case studies to analyze and implement various machine learning models.

My expertise spans across the entirety of the machine learning process, from data visualization to model testing and learning. I have delved into diverse areas, encompassing techniques for handling outliers, feature selection, and data resampling, leveraging Python's capabilities. I have also explored various methods to assess attribute correlations and tackle imbalanced data, both within attributes and labels, all through Python.

My ultimate goal is to continue embracing new challenges and exciting projects, learning from each experience, and actively working towards real-world problem-solving through the power of data analysis and machine learning.
